Interpolation is the reconstruction of the continuous-time signal from its discrete-time digital samples. This process for signal reconstruction is used in digital-to-analog converters.  A low-pass filter is needed in the interpolation process to bandlimit the signal to satisfy the sampling criteria.  Since the ideal low-pass filter is difficult to construct, a Zero-Order Hold and Linear Interpolator are used to approximate this low-pass filter.


Bandlimited_Interpolation outputs the impulse response of the Linear Interpolator and the Zero-Order Hold.
